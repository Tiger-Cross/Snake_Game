# Snake_Game
A basic web-based classic snake game

# Aim of the game
* Don't run the snake into his own tail: you die (and reset to the original size).
* Use your cursor keys: up, left, right, and down.
* Eat the red apple to grow your snake.

# Possible extensions
* add pause button, p, to pause the game.
* remove the wrapping ability of the snake so it dies when it hits a wall.
* increase the speed of the snake either as time goes on/as snake grows.
